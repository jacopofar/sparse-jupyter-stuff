These notebooks contain many experiments and code snippets which could not find place in a proper, well-organized and documented repository.
## Notebooks
* `Import_chat_logs_{1,2,3}`: import TSV chat logs in postgres, generate QA pairs, word co-occurrency and bigram tables
* `generate_messages`: (not really working) generate text based on a Markov and co-occurrency count from QA pairs
* `word_vector_play`: show some GloVe vectors usage for Italian language, can be applied to any language
